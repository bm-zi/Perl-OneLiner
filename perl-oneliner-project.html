<h1>Implementation and management of Perl One-liners</h1>

No more need to dig in PDF's or Google search to get the right Perl function for your job.
Using this simple web based application and you get the Perl one-liner function you need from a list of about 100 one-liners, and then you can view the output of the job handled by selected one-liner on screen right away.

Although the interface is very self-explanatory, but still a description is provided here:

1)
You select a Perl one-liner from list, either by filtering the list or just click directly on the one-liner.
When you confirm your selection, another window next to the current one, on the right hand side will pop up.

<img style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; width: 599px; height: 378px;" src='../images/perl-oneliner/2.png' alt='interface-2.png'>
<img style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; width: 599px; height: 378px;" src='../images/perl-oneliner/3.png' alt='interface-3.png'>

2)
After selecting a one-liner you will see the window on the right hand, showing you the ID and a short description of the selected one-liner, together with an area for more detailed information of the selected Perl one-liner.
When you are satisfied with the information for that one-liner which is going to be implemented for your purpose, then you just click on second confirmation button.

3)
Now you see another window frame in left button of screen, displaying options to input your data for respective one-liner.
You can upload your text file or enter your input in a text area. in either cases when you selected an option, then it will be showing a new window in the same area, asking you for the input information. If the selected Perl one-liner is requiring arguments,
then other windows are available to get values from you for those required function arguments.

4)
When you are submitting your input data then the 4th new window appears in buttom right of the screen. 
You now see the window which is the result of processing input data. An option for download is also available to have the result copied in a file.
